    "paragraph": "<b><p align =\"center\"> How to get accepted to Fullgate University </p></b>.By Alex Herd, Fullgate University Admissions Office. It is time to start applying for university. Some students will be successful, but others will not. If you have dreamed of being admitted to Fullgate University, this article can show you what to do to improve your chances of success. First, you must apply early. You must apply before the application deadline. This is, perhaps, the most important consideration. We receive a lot of applications from excellent students who we have to reject because they sent us their application far too late. Make sure to apply before January 1 7,h. Fullgate University believes that after-school activities such as volunteer work, sports participation, and employment are very important. We look for any activities that help develop a student's character. Your grades are not the only aspect we consider. Finally, Fullgate University looks closely at letters of recommendation. We require at least three letters of recommendation. These should be written by people such as your teachers, sports club coaches, employers and the leaders of any volunteer organizations you belong to. We suggest that you get these as soon as possible so you can submit them with your application.",

And yet it is not just the immediate outcome of the negotiation which is at stake but also the possibility of a positive, ongoing business relationship.<br><br>Here’s a simple example:”don’t mix business and pleasure.” We say, thinking ourselves to be efficient and “virtuous”. But trying to negotiate with that attitude in some other cultures may well put future relationships under a cloud. So, the first rule should be to study the culture of the people with whom you are going to negotiate.<br><br>Dr. Rod Steiner, assistant lecturer, Department of Business Studies, South Australian Institute of Technology.<br><br> <b>Passage 2:</b><br><br><b><p align =\"center\"> South Australian Institute of Technology<br> Department of Business Studies</p></b><br>44 Berwick St<br>Adelaide, <br>Australia 5066<br>November 24, 2006<br><br>Dear Dr. Steiner,<br><br>I read your article “Cross – Cultural Communication in Business Negotiations” with a great deal of interest.
